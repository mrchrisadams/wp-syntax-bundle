I've been pasting a fair few code snippets in my own Wordpress blog lately, that uses wp-syntax to provide nice readable code samples. All this bundle does is fill in the typical pasting syntax for me automatically, so I don't need to keep looking it up.

It's been useful to me, so I figured someone else might find it useful too.
